# Business-Intelligence-Shoppers-Prediction
This Business Intelligence project focuses on classifying online shoppers as Purchasers or Non-Purchasers using machine learning.  This project analyzes online shoppers behavior to predict whether they will make a purchase or not. Multiple machine learning models were used, with Gradient Boosting performing the best.
