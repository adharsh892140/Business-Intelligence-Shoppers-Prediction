# 🔗Business Intelligence Shoppers Prediction
This Business Intelligence project focuses on classying online shoppers as **Purchasers** or **Non-Purchasers** using machine learning. This project analyzes online shoppers behvior to predict whether they will make a purchase or not. Multiple machine learning models were used, with **Gradient Boosting** performing the best.

## ⏳Conclusion
      This project focused on understanding the behaviour of online shoppers and distinguishing between PURCHASERS and NON-PURCHASERS. By applying various supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and LightBGM, we aimed to accurately predict purchase intent. Among the models Gradient Boosting performed best, revealing strong predictive power. Clustering techniques were also used to uncover hidden patterns in user behaviour. This project highlights how machine learning can effectively classify online shoppers and support e-commerce businesses in targeting potential customers more strategically.
